# Vigenère’s Baguette

**Category:** OSINT  
**Flag:** `root{j1yu_n0_m3g4m1}`

## Summary
The task was image-based OSINT. I ran a reverse image search, which pointed to Paris. Cross-checking the scene in Street View confirmed the location and revealed the flag.

## Steps
1. Reverse image search to identify the city and likely neighborhood.
2. Opened the matching area in Google Maps.
3. Used Street View to compare architectural details and align the viewpoint.
4. Verified the location and extracted the flag.

## Tools Used
